Pointers




i := 5

Hard disk lot of space - we need to reverse some place to hold our data why?

because whenever we want to try access again I want to get that value


To access to this i variable two methods

1. By calling the variable name 
	fmt.Println(i)

2. By calling the address of the i variable
	fmt.Println(&i) - 0xsuradf3o1k
	fmt.Println(*i) - 5 
	
	
	
	& - Adress operator
	* - Dereferincing operator


package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	num := 5

	fmt.Println(num)
	fmt.Println(&num)
}


package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var name = "John"
	var ptr *string

	ptr = &name

	fmt.Println(*ptr)
}



structs:


map[string]int{
	"age":24
}

slice := []{45,2,23,1,2}


combination of all datatypes 

I want to have string, int, boolean etc

Structs collection of all datatypes

type - Keyword
Name of the struct - Employee
struct - Keyword
