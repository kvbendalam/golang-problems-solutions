channels


channels are nothing but, it is communication tool between two go routines


go routine 1 ======================== go routine 2

one go routine will act as sender

another go routine will act as a receiver


package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	ch := make(chan int)
	
	go func(){
		ch <- 42
	}()
	
	num := <-ch
	
	fmt.Println(num)
}


to create a channle we need to use make function


make(chan int)

chan is the key word to create a channel which is of type int

we can create any of channel data type

make(chan string)

it is a channel of string


for sending channel <- 42
for receiving channel 

	num := <-ch
