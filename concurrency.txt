concurrency:

able to handle multiple things at a time


function f(){
	task1()
	>10 seconds
	
	
	task2() yes we need to while task1 is going on
	
	> 5
	
	task3() yes we need to run while task2 is going on 

}



> 15 seconds

5 seconds ()Increasign the efifienceny

function task1(){

	----
	----
	----
	----
	
	taking lot of time to computer some result
	
	complex operation
	
	> 10 seconds
}


function task2(){
	----
	----
}

function task3(){
	-----
	-----
	---
}



parallelism:

large set of data -> we need to perfrom some operations on this large set of data
100000 lines we want perform operations


Multiple processsor will involve (multiple computers)




1 -> 100 minutes 

20000 -> 5 computers


20 mins



concurrency : 
1. system included

parallelism:
multiple systems are inclued


concurreny we can acheive in golagn


go routines -> acheiving concurrency
